Heaps, in the context of programs written in languages like C and C++, allow functions to allocate a temporary exclusive region of memory to store variables and structured data. Once allocated, these memory regions are permanently reserved until the memory is manually released by the programmer back to the heap manager, at which point the heap manager can “recycle” it for use by another bit of code. In order for programs to operate correctly, it is critically important that programmers using the heap follow a few simple rules. For example, they must avoid writing to addresses outside of the allocated region, and they must be careful to never use or write to data in an allocation that has been released back to the heap.
